(born 1992). Egyptian [soccer](/students/article/soccer/277111) (association football) player Mohamed Salah’s prolific scoring made him a star of both the English Premier League and the Egyptian national team. As a forward for [Liverpool FC](/students/article/Liverpool-FC/545001), he was voted the Premier League’s player of the season in 2017–18. He was also named the 2017 African Footballer of the Year.

Salah was born on June 15, 1992, in Basyoun, Egypt, north of Cairo. As a youth, he idolized such professional players as [Ronaldo](/students/article/Ronaldo/313274) and Zinedine Zidane, whose moves he tried to emulate during pickup games. At the age of 14 he joined the Egyptian club El Mokawloon’s youth team. He made his debut with El Mokawloon’s senior team in 2010. Salah’s speed and goal-scoring ability soon caught the attention of Swiss club FC Basel, which signed him to a contract in 2012. He helped lead FC Basel to the Swiss Super League title and an appearance in the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) Europa League semifinals in 2012–13. That season he received the Swiss Golden Player award as the Super League’s outstanding player.

In January 2014 Salah transferred to [Chelsea FC](/students/article/Chelsea-FC/545000) of the Premier League. Despite high expectations for Salah, he struggled during his time with Chelsea. He started in only six Premier League matches with the club before being loaned to Fiorentina of Italy’s top league, Serie A, in February 2015. Later that year he was loaned by Chelsea to another Serie A team, [AS Roma](/students/article/AS-Roma/545005). Salah’s play dramatically improved after his move to the Italian league. He completed a permanent transfer to AS Roma before the 2016–17 season. He recorded 19 goals and 13 assists that season and was chosen as AS Roma’s player of the year.

Salah returned to the Premier League in July 2017 after signing to play for Liverpool. He netted an astonishing 32 goals in Premier League matches in 2017–18, setting a new league record for the most goals scored by a player during a single 38-game season. Salah was rewarded with the Golden Boot as the Premier League’s top scorer. That season he also led Liverpool to the UEFA Champions League final, where the team lost to Spanish powerhouse [Real Madrid](/students/article/Real-Madrid/544995). Salah finished the season with an overall tally of 44 goals in all competitions. In May 2018 he garnered the Premier League’s player of the season award. He was only the third Liverpool player and the first Egyptian to receive that honor. In 2019 he helped Liverpool secure the Champions League title, scoring on an early penalty kick during the team’s 2–0 victory over [Tottenham Hotspur](/students/article/Tottenham-Hotspur/631255) in the final match. Salah was again Liverpool’s top goal scorer in 2019–20. He made 19 goals and 10 assists that season as the team captured the Premier League title.

In addition to his success with professional clubs, Salah was a driving force on the Egyptian national team. After initially playing on Egypt’s under-20 and under-23 teams, Salah made the first of his many appearances with the senior national squad in 2011. He powered the team to the 2017 African Cup of Nations final, where Egypt lost a close match to Cameroon. Later that year he helped Egypt qualify for the 2018 [World Cup](/students/article/World-Cup/487889) in Russia. It was the first time that Egypt had qualified for the tournament since 1990. Salah scored two goals in Egypt’s three World Cup matches in Russia, though the Egyptian team failed to advance past the tournament’s group stage.
